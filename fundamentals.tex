\chapter{Fundamentals}\label{ch:Fundamentals}

In order to be able to make use of the findings in this thesis,
a basic understanding of ray tracing both in general as well as in the context of acoustics simulation is required.
This chapter will provide a summary of the base idea of ray tracing
before then introducing specific concepts relevant to acoustics.

\section{Ray Tracing}\label{sec:FundamentalRT}

Both sound and light are generally known to be waves bouncing from wall to wall.
They start out from some emitter such as a loudspeaker and can eventually,
after bouncing off walls for any number of times, arrive at a receiver such as a microphone or an ear.
Ray tracing attempts to model this process of waves bouncing by splitting a wave into many individual rays,
each launched from the wave's emitter in a direction the wave would travel in too.
Most audio ray tracers assume emitters emit sound uniformly in all directions,
thus allowing them to simply launch each ray in a randomised direction.
\newline
Each ray's path through the scene is then individually simulated
by calculating which object it will next intersect with,
then calculating the intersection point and the direction the ray will bounce off of the object in.
Then, a new ray is launched from this intersection point in the resulting direction and the process is repeated
until some ending condition applies, at which point the ray is terminated.
If the ray intersects with a receiver object, the according information gets stored.
For acoustics, this is usually the intersection time and the energy the ray still had at intersection time.
Depending on the domain, the ray is then terminated or continues bouncing by passing through the receiver.
For acoustics, the latter behaviour is usually used.
\newline
Intersection checks are generally done by modelling objects using an equation that describes whether a point is on the object surface or not,
then injecting the ray's function into that equation and resolving.
With static objects, this check is trivial:
The only parameter to resolve for is the intersection time \(t\), and said parameter only occurs in the ray function,
usually making for a first-degree polynomial function.
\newline
As an example, an infinite surface \(S\) can be modelled using a point \(P_1\) on it as well as its normal \(n\).
Then, to tell if any point \(p\) is on \(S\), the vector from \(P_1\) to \(p\) can be compared to \(n\).
If they're orthogonal to each other (thus their dot product is 0), \(p\) is on \(S\):

\begin{equation}\label{StaticSurface}
    (p - P_1) \cdot n = 0
\end{equation}

For a polygon defined by its corner points \(P_{1}\) to \(P_{m}\), the same equation can be used,
with the difference that \(n\) needs to be determined from a set of at least three of the points.
The cross product of two vectors is always orthogonal to both vectors, so using three points \(P_{1}\) through \(P_{3}\),
\(n\) can be determined as

\begin{equation}\label{PolygonNormal}
    n = (P_{2} - P_{1}) \times (P_{3} - P_{1})
\end{equation}

Additionally, a polygon needs to further check whether \(p\) is actually inside the bounds defined by its corners.
For triangles, this can be done using barycentric coordinates.
\newline
\begin{figure}[t!]
    \begin{center}
    \includesvg{images/barycentric.svg}
    \end{center}
    \caption[Visualization of barycentric coordinates]{The barycentric coordinates of a point inside a triangle. Each coordinate is determined by the area of its subtriangle in relation to the whole triangle.}\label{fig:BarycentricExplain}
\end{figure}
Barycentric coordinates describe a point on a triangle by separating said triangle into three parts,
each with the given point and two corners of the triangle as its vertices.
Each coordinate then describes the relative size of that subtriangle with respect to the full triangle,
as shown in \autoref{fig:BarycentricExplain}.
\newline
Thus, every point on the triangle's surface can be described using three coordinates \((\alpha, \beta, \gamma)\).
For any point \(p\) that is inside the triangle,
\(0 \le \alpha \le 1\), \(0 \le \beta \le 1\), \(0 \le \gamma \le 1\) and \(\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1\).
If these conditions do not apply to \(p\), it is outside the triangle.
\newline
The naive way to calculate barycentric coordinates would be to calculate the areas of \(P_1P_2p\), \(P_1P_3p\), \(P_2P_3p\) and
divide them by the area of \(P_1P_2P_3\)~\cite{SM09}:
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small, caption={[Barycentric coordinate calculation]Barycentric coordinate calculation}, label={lst:barycentric}]
    normal = cross((p3 - p1), (p2 - p1));
    p1p2p = dot(normal, cross((p1 - p), (p2 - p)));
    p1p3p = dot(normal, cross((p3 - p), (p1 - p)));
    p2p3p = dot(normal, cross((p2 - p), (p3 - p)));
    p1p2p3 = p1p2p + p1p3p + p2p3p;
    alpha = p2p3p / p1p2p3;
    beta = p1p3p / p1p2p3;
    gamma = p1p2p / p1p2p3;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
This can be simplified by only computing two of the barycentric coordinates
and calculating the last one from the first two instead; if \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) have already been computed,
\(\gamma = 1 - \alpha - \beta\). This saves a division operation.
For further optimisation, the Lagrange identity \((a \times b) \cdot (c \times d) = (a \cdot c)(b \cdot d) - (a \cdot d)(b \cdot c)\)
can be used to replace the cross products with dot products, as shown by Ericson~\cite{Er04}.
\newline
In order to calculate the intersection point \(p\) for a ray tracer, the equation describing a ray then needs to be injected into the surface equation.
A ray \(R\)'s position at time \(t\), with \(R\) starting at the point \(P\) at time \(t_0\)
and travelling in the direction \(v\) can be defined as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{RayEq}
    R(t) = P + (t - t_0) \cdot v
\end{equation}

This equation can then be injected into the equation describing the primitive in place of \(p\) and resolved.
As an example, using~\eqref{StaticSurface}, this calculation goes as follows:

\begin{equation*}
    (P + (t - t_0) \cdot v - P_1) \cdot n = 0
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}\label{StaticSurfaceIntersect}
    t = \frac{(P_1 + t_0 \cdot v - P) \cdot n}{v \cdot n}
\end{equation}

If \(t\) exists and is greater than \(t_0\),
the point \(p = R(t)\) describes the intersection point and can be used for further checks
as well as bouncing.
If intersections exist for multiple objects,
only the lowest \(t\) is relevant as all other intersections would only happen if the ray didn't bounce off of the first object already.
\newline
The bouncing direction can be determined in a number of ways,
depending on the surface and how it reflects waves.
The easiest to understand behaviour is specular reflection,
where angle of incidence equals angle of departure -
i.e. a ray bounces off a surface in the same angle it approached it at,
such as when light bounces off a perfect mirror.
The specularly reflected direction \(r\) can be calculated from the inbound direction \(i\) and the surface normal \(n\) as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SpecularReflection}
    r = i - (2 \cdot i \cdot n) \cdot n
\end{equation}
Different reflection modes are usually domain dependent
and not important for a general understanding of ray tracing.
\newline
Alongside the launch position and direction,
rays usually store the energy or other information of the wave they represent in some form.
This information tends to get altered with each bounce -
For acoustics simulation, the ray's energy simply gets decremented depending on the bouncing material.
\newline
This stored energy can be used as an ending condition:
Once the ray's energy goes below a certain threshold,
the ray is terminated as any energy it carries becomes insignificant.
Other domains, where the ray's stored data cannot fully be used to determine its relevance,
use other ending conditions.
One simple condition often seen in computer graphics is bounce count:
Each ray also counts the amount of times it already bounced.
Once a specified threshold of bounces is reached, the ray is discarded.

\section{Acoustics Simulation}\label{sec:FundamentalAcoustics}

The goal of acoustics simulation is to get a picture of when sound waves arrive at a receiver and with what amount of energy.
A simulation creates either an impulse or energetic response,
which can in turn be used to determine acoustic properties of the room
or applied to a sound recording in order to simulate it being recorded in this room.
The latter process is called `auralization'.
\newline
One common measure for room properties is the reverberation time \(T_{60}\),
defined as the point after which the impulse/energetic response is consistently at least 60 decibels quieter than the initial signal.
This can be used as a metric to determine how long a sound will take to ring out in a room.
\newline
Another useful measure is the sound clarity \(C_{50}\)~\cite{AB18}~\cite{PMG22},
comparing the reverberation's first 50 milliseconds' worth of sound energy to the remainder of the reverberation.
\(C_{50}\) as a metric is based on the idea that for speech,
any reflections of the sound arriving more than 50 milliseconds later than the first response are harming intelligibility,
whereas signal arriving within that 50 millisecond window is helpful in making speech more understandable.
Thus, a higher \(C_{50}\) means that speech is easier to understand under the room's acoustic conditions.
\newline
For a known energetic response \(e_m, 0 \le m < o\), where each \(m\) represents one sample of the response and there are a total of \(o\) samples,
and a sample rate \(f\), \(C_{50}\) can be calculated as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:C50}
    C_{50} = 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{m=0}^{50 \cdot f - 1}e_m}{\displaystyle\sum_{m=50 \cdot f}^{o}e_m} \right) dB
\end{equation}

The impulse/energetic response of a room can usually be divided into three parts:
`direct sound' is the part of the sound wave that can immediately travel from emitter to receiver without bouncing off a wall,
the `early reflections' are early, not yet diffuse echoes
and the remaining diffuse hall ringing out is called `late reverberation'.
\newline
The difference between an impulse and an energetic (also called energy-time) response is the data being modelled.
An energy-based model produces an energetic response \(p^2(t)\).
This is sufficient to make statements about a room's acoustics,
but cannot be used for proper auralization as phase information is lost.
The solution to this problem is provided by pressure-based models,
where instead of the energy \(p^2\),
the sound pressure \(p\) is computed as a complex number that also holds phase information.
\newline
As the energy response is the squared impulse response,
converting from the latter to the former is trivial.
The inverse conversion becomes more complicated as the phase information needs to be reconstructed,
usually from the ray's travelling distance.
\newline
For simplicity's sake, this thesis will only focus on energy-based models.
The concepts introduced can be equally applied to pressure-based models.

\section{Geometric Acoustics Simulation}\label{sec:FundamentalGA}

The changes to ray tracing specific to acoustics simulation mostly affect rays' bouncing behaviour.
Firstly, when a ray bounces off a surface,
that surface will absorb part of the ray's energy.
How much of the incoming energy is reflected depends on the surface's impedance
as well as the angle of incidence \(\theta\).
\newline
For energy-based geometric acoustics, this is usually modelled through an absorption coefficient \(\alpha(\theta)\),
which in turn can be calculated from a wall's plane-wave reflection coefficient \(R(\theta)\) often determined through measurement.
Some systems simplify this to a single random incidence absorption coefficient \(\alpha_{rand}\)
computed as the average of all possible incidence angles.
For this thesis, the absorption coefficient is denoted as a number between 0 and 1,
where 0 means all energy is absorbed (the ray terminates) and 1 means that all energy gets reflected.
\newline
Another important factor of acoustics that needs to be modelled is the effect of uneven surfaces.
Specifically, imperfections in a surface that are within the same order of magnitude as the wavelength greatly affect that surface's acoustic behaviour
as waves are then not fully reflected in a specular manner.
There are several models to simplify simulation of these non-specular reflections,
the simplest being the scattering coefficient.
\newline
The scattering coefficient, also denoted as a number between 0 and 1 in this thesis,
denotes the ratio of how much energy a wall or material reflects specularly as opposed to non-specularly,
splitting the signal into a specular and a diffuse component.
A value of 0 describes a perfectly even and specularly reflecting surface (like a perfect mirror for light),
whereas 1 implies a fully diffuse reflection.
\newline
The distribution of this diffuse reflection is not specified by the scattering coefficient,
so most systems simply assume one reflection model applying the same on all walls,
the simplest model being an even distribution of energy in all directions.
\newline
The naive way to implement this in a ray tracing system would be for a bounce to not just emit one new ray, but several,
with one keeping the specular component's energy and being reflected specularly,
while the diffuse component's energy is distributed among the remaining rays,
which in turn are randomly spread across the hemisphere defined by the surface normal.
This quickly becomes computationally expensive as the number of rays increases exponentially with each bounce.
\newline
In practice, to avoid the resulting performance problems,
some systems (such as EAR~\cite{Kr17}) generate a random number between 0 and 1 for each collision.
If the scattering coefficient is greater than this random number,
the ray is sent off into a random direction in the hemisphere defined by the surface's normal,
otherwise it is reflected specularly as per \ref{eq:SpecularReflection}.
As a high amount of rays is sent out into the scene,
the result of this random distribution eventually matches the distribution defined by the scattering coefficient.
This is not as accurate as splitting up rays,
but usually close enough to be a justifiable optimisation.
